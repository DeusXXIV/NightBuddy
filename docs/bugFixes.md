First APK Release Run

Bugfixes:
    If you turn the filter on and off via the notification panel via the app, the filter state in the app remains separate. The filter turns off, but the in-app state still says on. 

Notes: 
    Improve the interoperability between components. Some components are disjointed in between features.
